# Moodle Prometheus reporting endpoint
A local plugin that presents an endpoint for Prometheus metric gathering.
Can be used either in Prometheus or as an InfluxDB v2 scraper

## Developing
Plugins can add their own metrics to the output by adding their own `plugin_name_prometheus_get_metrics(int $window)` function
to lib.php. This function **must** return either one or more `\local_prometheus\metric` objects, or an empty array.
Plugins **should** give users the option to toggle metric gathering for that plugin on or off.

The `$window` parameter is a unix timestamp and is used for determining the cutoff for a 'current' value. For example to determine 
the number of currently online users we can only look at the last access timestamp. In this case, `$window` would mean "treat users 
active since this timestamp as currently online". 

Example implementation in lib.php:
```php

/**
 * Fetch metrics for the plugin
 *
 * @param int $window
 * @return metric[] 
 */
mod_example_prometheus_get_metrics(int $window): array {
    $metric = new metric(
        'moodle_mod_example_foo',
        metric::TYPE_GAUGE,
        'optional HELP text, can be omitted'
    );
    
    $metric->add_value(new metric_value(
        [ 'label' => 'foo' ],
        12
    ));
    
    return [ $metric ];
}
```

## Installation
The plugin requires Moodle 3.9 or later, and PHP 7.4 or later. You will also need some way of gathering, storing, and
using the metrics that the plugin generates.

There's no special installation steps or instructions, just install it as you would any other plugin
